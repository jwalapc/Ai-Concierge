# Action Plan — Hyper-Local AI Concierge

Derived from [FUNDABILITY-ASSESSMENT.md](./FUNDABILITY-ASSESSMENT.md). Use this as a checklist for pre-seed execution.

---

## Phase 1: Define & Validate (Weeks 1–4)

- [ ] **Pick ONE vertical** — Food discovery | Wellness | Entertainment | Home services. Document choice and rationale.
- [ ] **Pick ONE geography** — Bengaluru, Mumbai, or Delhi. List 20–50 target merchants/categories.
- [ ] **Define the “one decision journey”** — e.g. “Where should I eat tonight?” end-to-end: discovery → shortlist → decision → reservation/booking → (optional) follow-up.
- [ ] **Draft differentiation one-liner** — “We’re not ChatGPT because we [proprietary local data / end-to-end execution / outcome learning / local integrations].”
- [ ] **Recruit 20–50 beta users** — From target geography + vertical. Set up waitlist or invite-only signup.

---

## Phase 2: MVP (Months 1–3)

- [ ] **MVP scope** — Single vertical, single city, one clear journey (e.g. restaurant discovery + reservation).
- [ ] **Data strategy from Day 1** — What you’ll log: queries, options shown, choice made, outcome (e.g. rating/feedback). Design schema and storage.
- [ ] **Outcome feedback loop** — “Did this work?” after each decision. Store and use for ranking/recommendations.
- [ ] **Unit economics draft** — CAC (channel + cost), LTV (subscription or commission), target payback. Update as you get data.

---

## Phase 3: Pre-Seed Readiness (Months 3–6)

- [ ] **100–500 beta users** with 40%+ weekly active usage.
- [ ] **NPS >50** and 5–10 “can’t live without it” quotes.
- [ ] **One-pager for investors** — Problem, solution, moat (data + workflow), vertical + geography, ask ($100K–500K), use of funds.
- [ ] **Pitch: “Why not ChatGPT?”** — Slide or section with the four bullets (local data, execution, outcomes, integrations).

## Quick Reference: Moats to Build Early

| Moat | First concrete step |
|------|----------------------|
| Proprietary hyper-local data | Log every recommendation, choice, and outcome; design DB schema |
| Workflow embedding | Own at least one full flow (e.g. discover → book) in your product |
| Network effects | Use aggregate outcome data to improve ranking for all users |
| Merchant relationships | 5–10 pilot partnerships in chosen city + vertical |
| Vertical specialization | Ship and measure one vertical only; no “AI for everything” |
